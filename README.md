Weather Forecast App
=======

About the project
-----------

In this project I made a weather forecast application using the `OpenWeatherMap API`. My main goal was to get a better understanding using APIs and create reuseable components. I also aimed to learn how to write basic unit tests and integration tests.
The layout currently only available in desktop view, but my long term goal is to make it responsive. The design is completely my idea, the microinteractions too.
I used `ReactJS, Tailwind and Jest`.

**Features:**
* You can search any city on the planet
* You can add them as your favorite city and pin on the dashboard
* ...to be continued (the project is in progress)


To run the project you need to do:
-----------
1. Clone the project
2. To the .env file, insert valid OpenWeatherMap API key
3. npm i
4. npm run start
5. Start to explore the weather by choosing a city
